        <p>Kron is a database project I built with Flask and SQLite in order
        to help me keep better track of my research. History is complex, 
        and the connections can be subtle. Kron is designed to be flexible 
        and to remember people, events, documents, and ideas the same way
        that I do&mdash;but much less forgetfullly!</p>
