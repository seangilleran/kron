#Kron

Kron is a database project built in Python with Flask in order to 
help me keep better track of my research. History is complex, and the 
connections can be subtle. Kron is designed to be flexible and to 
remember people, events, documents, and ideas the same way that 
I doâ€”but much less forgetfullly!
